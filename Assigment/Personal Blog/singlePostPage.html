        <p>If you are in a position where you can buy some extra things for your travel, do it! If you aren’t, don’t worry because you will be fine without these things! You can make it work I know it.

            Some of these things I own, and some I don’t. I will let you know how I feel about them.

            If you’re getting ready for a fun vacay, I recommend checking out my travel tips and tricks post!</p>
        <p>A JEWELRY CASE
            Our first one is a majestic jewelry case (btw these are in no particular order).

            Amazon Travel Finds

            This is the exact one that I bought. It is so cute and pink, I love it. Okay when I was a little girl, I was the opposite of girly and claimed to hate pink. I literally felt too weird to say the word cute. But now, I think I really do love pink things.

            I have a pink computer, a pink backpack, a pink jewelry box, and a pink car.

            Just kidding my car is not pink.

            This jewelry case can hold about 5 or 6 rings, depending on how good you are at shoving them in there. The little hooks at the top are for your necklaces, how convenient huh?

            I have used many different ways to pack my necklaces while traveling and all of them sucked. I have wrapped them in toilet paper and then in a plastic bag put them in this little jar thing (dumb, they definitely got so tangled), and I just flat out didn’t take necklaces because I didn’t know how to pack them.</p>
